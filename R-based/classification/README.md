This project uses the ILPD dataset that can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+%28Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset%29)

We utilize this dataset to perform some classification in the form of decision trees. After creating various models in R with varying predicitor variables, we perfrom analysis on on results through confusion matrices and evaluate metrics such as TPR, FPR, etc.

Following this we further evaluate our results by plotting ROC curves for our models and evaluating the AUC.
