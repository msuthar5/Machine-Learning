In probability theory, Bayes' theorem (or Bayes' law after Rev Thomas Bayes
) provides relation between the conditional and marginal probabilities of t
wo random events. It is usually used to calculate posterior probabilities g
iven observations. For example: a patient might be observed to show certain
 symptoms. Bayes' theorem could be used to compute the probability that a c
ertain diagnosis is right, given that observation.

Since it is a formal theorem, Bayes' theorem holds in all popular interpret
ations of probability. 
Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events
 a and b, where b has a non-vanishing probability:

    P(a|b) = P(a|b)P(a)/P(b)

Terms in Bayes' theorem are named by a convention:

P(A) is the prior probability or marginal probability of A. It does not tak
e into account any information about B and therefore is considered “prior”.
P(A|B) is the conditional probability of A, given B. It it is derived from 
or depends upon the specified value of B. Usually it is called the posterio
r probability 
P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A.
P(B) (a.k.a. the normalizing constant) is the prior or marginal probability
 of B.

Obviously, Bayes' theorem describes the way in which one's assumptions abou
t observing the event'a' are changed by having observed the event 'b'.
