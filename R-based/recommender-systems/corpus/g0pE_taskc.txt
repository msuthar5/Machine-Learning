The representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector spac
e is known as the vector space vector space model and is fundamental to a h
ost of information retrieval (IR) operations including scoring documents on
 a query, document classification, and document clustering.We first develop
 the basic ideas underlying vector space scoring; a pivotal step in this de
velopment is the view of queries as vectors in the same vector space as the
 document collection.
