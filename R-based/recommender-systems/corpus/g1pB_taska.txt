Inheritance is one of the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming.  I
t’s objective is to add more detail to pre-existing classes whilst still allo
wing the methods and variables of these classes to be reused.  The easiest 
way to look at inheritance is as an “…is a kind of” relationship.  For example, a guitar is a kind of string instrument, elect
ric, acoustic and steel stringed are all types of guitar.
The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes
 become.  An example here would be books.  Books generally fall into two ca
tegories, fiction and non-fiction.  Each of these can then be sub-divided i
nto more groups.  Fiction for example can be split into fantasy, horror, ro
mance and many more.  Non-fiction splits the same way into other topics suc
h as history, geography, cooking etc.  History of course can be sub-divided
 into time periods like the Romans, the Elizabethans, the World Wars and so
 on.
