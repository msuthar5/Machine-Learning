The definition of term depends on the application. Typically terms are sing
le words, keywords, or longer phrases. If the words are chosen to be the te
rms, the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabul
ary A document is represented as a vector. Each dimensions corresponds to a
 separate terms. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector 
is non-zero.
Relevancy rankings of documents in a keyword search can be calculated, usin
g the assumptions of document similarities theory, by comparing the deviati
on of angles between each document vector and the original query vector whe
re the query is represented as same kind of vector as the documents.
LIMITATION:
There is some limitation of vector space model.
Models based on and extending the vector space model include:
•	Generalized vector space model.
•	(enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model [1] (eTVSM) — Extends the vector space model by removing the constraint that the term-ve
ctors be orthogonal. In contrast to the generalized vector space model the 
(enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model does not depend on concurrence-ba
sed similarities between terms. The enhancement of the enhanced Topic-based
 Vector Space Model  (compared to the not enhanced one) is a proposal on ho
w to derive term-vectors from an Ontology.
