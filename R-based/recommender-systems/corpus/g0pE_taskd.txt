Bayes Theorem is an important theorem relating conditional probabilities, i
t allows us to calculate PROB(A|B) from PROB(B|A). Bayes Theorem is importa
nt because it can save us from gathering vast amounts of statistical eviden
ce. The main theory is PROB(A|B) = PROB(B|A) * PROB(A) /PROB(B), it means U
sing PROB(WIN|RAIN) from earlier, we can find the probability that it raine
d on a day that Harry won a race.
