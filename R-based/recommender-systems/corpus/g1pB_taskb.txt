A website’s page rank, is how ‘important’ it is on the web.  It is essentially a popularity meter.  Popularity or im
portance is determined by the amount of links relating to the page there ar
e, there are four different types.  Inbound, links from other pages to your
s.  Outbound, links from your page to others.  Dangling, links to a page wh
ich has no links to others.  Deep, links to a specific page, usually bypass
ing the homepage.  The page rank algorithm takes the probability of a ‘random surfer’ becoming bored and requesting another ‘random page’ (otherwise known as the dampening factor) away from 1 and divides this num
ber by the number of pages in the system, adding it to the dampening factor
 multiplied by the page rank of a linked page divided by the number of outb
ound links on that linked page.  Adding on this last section for every othe
r page linked to from the original page.  Google uses this algorithm to ass
ist intentional surfers in finding the best websites to suit their needs.  
One of the problems with this popularity algorithm is that it is easily man
ipulated and can give false values, hence the frequent recalculating of pag
e ranks.
