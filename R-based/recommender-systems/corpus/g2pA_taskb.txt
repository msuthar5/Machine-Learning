The  algorithm that Google uses to assign a weighting to each element of a 
linked set of documents, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative impor
tance within the set. 
A particular websites PageRank results from a "vote" from other pages on th
e Internet about how important that website actually is. A link to a page i
s seen as a vote of support. The PageRank depends on the PageRank rating an
d number of all pages that have links to it. Additionally, if a page is lin
ked to by pages with a high PageRank rating, this increases the rating of t
he original page.
The PageRank scale ranges from 0-10. The rating of a certain page is genera
lly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the perceived quali
ty of the pages providing the links. 
PageRank could be described as a probability distribution representing the 
chance that someone randomly clicking on links will reach a certain page. T
he PageRank calculations require iterations through the collection of web p
ages to alter approximate PageRank values to accurately reflect the actual 
rank.
In order to prevent spamming, Google releases little information on the way
 in which a PageRank is calculated. The PageRank algorithm has led to many 
sites being spammed with links in an attempt to artificially inflate the Pa
geRank of the linked page, notably in blog comments and message boards. In 
2005 a ‘nofollow’ tag was added as an attribute of a HTML link to be used where Google shoul
dn’t change the PageRank of the linked page as a result of the link.
