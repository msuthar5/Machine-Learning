Dynamic programming is a method of providing solutions to potential problem
s exhibiting the properties of overlapping sub problems and optimal structu
re. This is highly used in dynamic programming. The advantage being the les
s time consumption in comparison to other amateur methods.
It has to be kept in mind that the term programming in the field has got no
thing to do with computer programming at all. On the other hand it is deriv
ed from the term mathematical programming which is a similar word used for 
optimization. Here by meaning that a program can be an optimal plan for the
 produced action. The typical example could be of a finalized schedule of e
vents at an exhibition. This leads to the concept of programming being a he
lper in finding an acceptable plan of action, which can also be termed as a
n algorithm
The subproblems are, themselves, solved by dividing them into sub-subproble
ms, and so on, until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant
 time.
Overlapping subproblems means that the same subproblems are used to solve m
any different larger problems. Example could be of Fibonacci sequence; F3 =
 F1 + F2 and F4 = F2 + F3 — computing each number involves computing F2. Because both F3 and F4 are ne
eded to compute F5, a naive approach to computing F5 may end up computing F
2 twice or more. It means that whenever we encounter with  overlapping subp
roblems, a naive approach may waste to,e recomputing optimal solutions to t
he already solved subproblems.
